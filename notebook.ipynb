You'll analyze this data to provide insights on private rooms to the real estate company.\n\nThere are three files in the data folder: airbnb_price.csv, airbnb_room_type.xlsx, airbnb_last_review.tsv.\n\n    What are the dates of the earliest and most recent reviews? Store these values as two separate variables with your preferred names.\n    How many of the listings are private rooms? Save this into any variable.\n    What is the average listing price? Round to the nearest two decimal places and save into a variable.\n    Combine the new variables into one DataFrame called review_dates with four columns in the following order: first_reviewed, last_reviewed, nb_private_rooms, and avg_price. The DataFrame should only contain one row of values.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"90c1c398-ace4-427f-bde7-92b4acdd77ed"},{"source":"How to approach the project\n\n1. Loading the data\n\nUse appropriate pandas methods to read the three different file types into three DataFrames. Take a look at the data in each.\nUsing pandas methods to read files\n\n    pd.read_csv() can be used to read in comma or tab-separated values files. For TSV files, you'll need to specify the proper sep or delimiter parameter, e.g., sep='\\t'.\n    pd.read_excel() can be used to read Excel files.\n\nLooking at the data\n\n    It's always a good idea to use .head() to have a look at your data after importing.\n\n2. Merging the three DataFrames\n\nYou can answer the questions most efficiently by combining the three DataFrames into a single DataFrame after importing them.\nMerging two DataFrames at a time on a common column\n\n    You can use the pd.merge() method with two DataFrames at a time, using the on parameter with the common column name, e.g., \"listing_id\".\n    Two merges can combine all three DataFrames.\n\n3. Determining the earliest and most recent review dates\n\nTo compare review dates, you'll need to convert the relevant reviews column to a date format.\nConverting reviews data to a date format\n\n    To convert the \"last_review\" column to the helpful datetime type, you can use the pd.to_datetime() function, specifying the desired date format parameter based on the date values currently in the table.\n\nFinding the earliest and most recent dates\n\n    Once you have converted the \"last_review_date\" column to datetime format, you can use the .min() and .max() functions to find the oldest and most recent reviews respectively.\n\n4. Finding how many listings are private rooms\n\nYou may have noticed that room_type has variations in capitalization. Use pandas to clean the data to get a reliable count of private rooms listings.\nCleaning data with pandas\n\n    Standardizing capitalization in string data to all lower case is a common technique in data cleaning. This can be accomplished with the \"room_type\" column using the str.lower() method.\n\nCounting the number of private rooms\n\n    Examine the unique values of the \"room_type\" column.\n    You can then filter the data using one of several possible methods so it only contains values representing private rooms.\n    After this, make use of .shape[0] to get the desired count.\n\n5. Finding the average price of listings\n\nYou'll need to convert the price data to float values to find their mean.\nConverting to numeric type\n\n    You'll want to strip out the \" dollars\" from the \"price\" column using .str.replace() on it.\n    You can chain that with the .astype() method then to convert to the desired type.\n\nFinding the mean\n\n    Find the mean of a pandas Series by applying the .mean() method to the relevant column or variable.\n\n6. Creating a DataFrame with the four solution values\n\nCombine the insights gathered into one DataFrame called review_dates containing four columns and one row of data, and round the avg_price to two decimal places.\nLoading the solution data into a DataFrame\n\n    Pass a dictionary into the pd.DataFrame() constructor specifying the desired column names (\"first_reviewed:, \"last_reviewed\", \"nb_private_rooms\", and \"avg_price\") as keys, and your saved variables as values.\n    As the DataFrame will contain a single row, you'll need to either provide each variable (value) as a list, e.g., [first_reviewed], or set index equal to [0].\n\nRounding a number\n\n    To round the average listing price you can use the built-in round() function, specifying the variable to round and the number of decimal places to round to.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f8c3c6c2-c441-47a9-be41-3b000ddbadee"},{"source":"![NYC Skyline](nyc.jpg)\n\nWelcome to New York City, one of the most-visited cities in the world. There are many Airbnb listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months.

files are three common formats for storing data. \nThree files containing data on 2019 Airbnb listings are available to you:\n\n**data/airbnb_price.csv**\nThis is a CSV file containing data on Airbnb listing prices and locations.\n- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n- **`price`**: nightly listing price in USD\n- **`nbhood_full`**: name of borough and neighborhood where listing is
